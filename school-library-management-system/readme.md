# School Library Management System

This is a browser-based school library management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The system allows users to manage books, students, borrowing and returning of books, all without requiring a backend or database. Data is stored temporarily using the browser's localStorage.

## Features

- View and manage a book catalog
- Add, edit, and delete books
- Borrow and return books
- Manage student records
- Track issued books and late returns
- Fully responsive layout using Bootstrap
- Clean and interactive UI

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (with Bootstrap 5)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- DataTables for table functionality
- LocalStorage for temporary data persistence

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
3. Start using the library system — no setup or installation required.

## Limitations

- Data is not stored permanently — it's saved only in the browser's localStorage.
- Refreshing or clearing browser storage will remove all data.
- No backend or user authentication is implemented.

## Future Improvements

- Connect to a backend with a real database for persistent storage.
- Add login system with roles (admin, student).
- Implement borrowing history and return due date tracking.
